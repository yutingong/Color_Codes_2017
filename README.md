# Color Codes

<p>My practice probes into the fluid materialty of paint and the fluid boundaries painting shares with other disciplines.
<i>Color Codes</i> was created with html + css codes, where codes are the ingredients to image making as much as paint is.
<i>Color Codes</i> dissolves the boundaries painting shares with the programming language of creative coding as well as the format in which we experience an artwork.
It tests the limits of our visual perception in our user interface experiences and where visual disruptions in our everyday visual culture influences subjectivities and affect our reading of visual information. </p>
